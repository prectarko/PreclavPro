# PreclavPro2102
PreclavPro, version February 2021, is a software for QSPR/QSAR calculations. 
PreclavPro make also molecular similarity (by chemical structure, shape, size, hydrofilicity, flexibility), Applicability Domain, logP and intramolecular synergy calculations.
For some databases (up to 3000 molecules) the program calculates, for each anayzed molecule (up to 99 atoms), up to 150,000 descriptors.
The program uses powerful unusual procedures for the selection of the significant descriptors and equations and for identification and elimination of outliers. 
The files kitD...kitY are the archives of the installation kits(five modules), under WindowsXP.
The files PreclavD...PreclavY are the archives of the sources (five modules), in VisualBasic5.
